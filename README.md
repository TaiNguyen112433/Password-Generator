Worked together with Baylor Hinshaw

This is a password generator. it creates a random password depending on what you select. You have 5 options Length, Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, or Symbols. You can mix this to get any password you would like. The longer is better. Once you have chosen your options you press "Generate Password". Than it will gernrate and show in the box above.

This was homework was very difficult I had trouble trying to get a password to display, but everything else worked along very well.
